# minimax_tictactoe

Do you like to lose? This TicTacToe AI in unbeatable!

A command line TicTacToe app that uses the MiniMax algorithm.

It has three difficulty settings

1. Easy = Random moves
2. Medium = Hard coded rules to designed to block the opponent. 
3. Hard = MiniMax algorithm that searches for the best move. It will never lose.

Further Development

I want to implement alpha-beta pruning to decrease the size of the search space and increase speed.
